working from the article "building your first node application" by scotch.io  (They have since taken it down)
Node.JS is very cool. Next step is to deploy this to Heroku  

I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp, I'm looking for my first dev job.  
I know Ruby / Rails, JavaScript / jQuery / AJAX,  HTML / CSS, and SQL. I've used Ionic (Angular for mobile), but  
don't remember much about it. I'm teaching myself Node.JS and   Angular 2. I recently attended Angular Summit 2017 
and an Angular workshop / MeetUp, I'm serious about learning Angular 2. 

I'm a leader, I'm responsible, and I'm low drama.
